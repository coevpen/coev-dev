                I'm a Full Stack Web Developer leveraging my customer service and logistics background
                to bridge the gap between backend and an intuitive user interface. I'm known by my peers as 
                detail oriented and essential to the team. 
                <br/><br/>
                As a natural leader, I've helmed project planning and communicated between multiple levels
                of management and customers both in my web development projects and in all my customer service positions.
                I feel the best way to work together and get things done is to communicate effectively, provide updates, and assist others.
